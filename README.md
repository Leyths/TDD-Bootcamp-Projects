TDD-Bootcamp-Projects
=====================

Somewhere to keep Java projects during a TDD course. Projects are likely incomplete or contain bugs.

Romaniser
---------
Converts an arabic number (eg, 7) to its Roman Numeral equivalent (VII). Should work with all cases on [this](http://literacy.kent.edu/Minigrants/Cinci/romanchart.htm) chart. 

LotteryCheck (Incomplete)
------------

This is incomplete as was used primarily as a way of specifying tests for interfaces and not complete classes. Is supposed to specify an interface for taking data from a 3rd party source and checking if a given set of numbers+date would give the holder a prize.

MobileBilling
-------------
Exercise to simulate cross-team communication.
